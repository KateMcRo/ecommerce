## Description

This is the back end for an e-commerce site. I was given a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

- Data models were essential to know what to input when testing the routes
- Writing the routes was repetative and helped commit the try/catch statements to memory.
- With this project I discovered the difference between a status code 200 and 201 (OK vs Created)

## Usage

The routes can be tested with Insomnia. Here is a screenshot of what the Category data looks like from a GET request:
